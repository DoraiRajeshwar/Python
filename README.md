# Assignment: identifying groups of similar wines
A sommelier is a trained professional who spends his or her day tasting different wines, and
identifying similarities (or sometimes dissimilarities) between these. Given this is clearly an exhausting
task, you have been hired to develop a software capable of grouping similar wines together. Your
software will load a data set containing information about each wine (Alcohol content, alkalinity of ash,
Proanthocyanins, colour intensity, etc) and identify which wines are similar.
Luckily, your employer has already identified a suitable algorithm and designed the software for you.
All you are required to do is to write the actual source code (with comments).

# Technical details:
You’ll be using different data structures to accomplish the below. Your assignment must contain the
code for the functions and methods below. If you wish you can write more functions and methods, but
those described below must be present.

# 1) Class: matrix
You will code a class called matrix, which will have an attribute called array_2d. This attribute is
supposed to be a NumPy array containing numbers in two dimensions. The class matrix must have
the following methods:
(in these, the parameters are in addition to self)

# load_from_csv
This method should have one parameter, a file name (including, if necessary, its path and extension).
This method should read this CSV file and load its data to the array_2d of matrix. Each row in this file
should be a row in array_2d. Notice that in CSV files a comma separates columns (CSV = comma
separated values).
You should also write code so that
m = matrix(‘validfilename.csv’)
Creates a matrix m with the data in the file above in array_2d.

# standardise
This method should have no parameters. It should standardise the array_2d in the matrix calling this
method. For details on how to standardise a matrix, read the appendix.

# get_distance
This method should have three parameters, two matrices (let us call them other_matrix and weights)
and a number (let us call it beta). If the matrix calling this method and the matrix weights have only
one row, this function should return a matrix containing the weighted Euclidean distance between the
row in the matrix calling this method and each of the rows in other_matrix. For details about how to
calculate this distance, read the appendix.
To be clear: if other_matrix has n rows, the matrix returned in this method will have n rows and 1
column.

# get_count_frequency
This method should have no parametes, and it should work if the array_2d of the matrix calling this
method has only one column. This method should return a dictionary mapping each element of the
array_2d to the number of times this element appears in array_2d.

# 2) Functions
The code should also have the functions (i.e. not methods, so not part of the class matrix) below. No
code should be outside any function or method in this assignment.

# get_initial_weights
This function should have one parameter, an integer m. This function should return a matrix with 1
row and m columns containing random values, each between zero and one. The sum of these m
values should be equal to one.

# get_centroids
This function should have three parameters: (i) a matrix containing the data, (iii) the matrix S, (iii) the
value of K. This function should implement the Step 9 of the algorithm described in the appendix. It
should return a matrix containing K rows and the same number of columns as the matrix containing
the data.

# get_groups
This function should have three parameters: a matrix containing the data, and the number of groups
to be created (K), and a number beta (for the distance calculation). This function follows the algorithm
described in the appendix. It should return a matrix S (defined in the appendix). This function should
use the other functions you wrote as much as possible. Do not keep repeating code you already
wrote.

# get_new_weights
This function takes three parameters: a matrix containing the data, a matrix containing the centroids,
and a matrix S (see the algorithm in the Appendix). This function should return a new matrix weights
with 1 row and as many columns as the matrix containing the data (and the matrix containing the
centroids). Follow Step 10 of the algorithm in the Appendix.

# run_test
Your code must contain the function below (do not change anything)
def run_test():
m = matrix(‘Data.csv’)
for k in range(2,5):
for beta in range(11,25):
S = get_groups(m, k, beta/10)
print(str(k)+‘-’+str(beta)+‘=’+str(S.get_count_frequency()))
The aim of this function is just to run a series of tests. By consequence, here (and only here) you can
use hard-coded values for the strings containing the filenames of data and values for K.

# More details
You will implement a data-driven algorithm that creates groups of entities (here, an entity is a wine,
described as a row in our data matrix) that are similar. If two entities are assigned to the same group
by the algorithm, it means they are similar. This will create groups of similar wines. Your software just
needs the number of groups the user wants to partition the data into, the data itself, and a numeric
value for Beta.
The number of partitions (K) is clearly a positive integer. Your software should only allow values in the
interval [2, n-1], where n is the number of rows in the data. This way you’ll avoid trivial partitions. You
can test values of Beta that are higher than 1.
Your software should follow the algorithm described in the appendix and generate a matrix S
indicating to which group (1, 2, …, K) each entity (wine, a row in the data matrix) has been assigned
to. Clearly S will have n elements.

# Appendix

# Data standardization

Let 𝐷 be a data matrix, so that 𝐷𝑖𝑗 is the value of 𝐷 at row i and column j. You can standardize 𝐷 by
following the equation below.

𝐷′𝑖𝑗 = 𝐷𝑖𝑗 − 𝐷𝑗/[𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐷𝑗) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛⁡(𝐷𝑗)]

where 𝐷𝑗 is the average of column j, 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐷𝑗 ) is the highest value in column j, and 𝑚𝑖𝑛⁡(𝐷𝑗 ) is the
lowest value in column j. 𝐷′𝑖𝑗 is the standardized version of 𝐷𝑖𝑗 – the algorithm below should only be
applied to 𝐷′𝑖𝑗 (i.e. do not apply the algorithm below to 𝐷𝑖𝑗 ).

# Basic notation for the algorithm

n = number of rows of in the data matrix
m = number of columns in the data matrix
K = number of clusters (notice that k is not the same thing as K)
Beta = exponent used in the distance calculation

# Clustering algorithm

1. Set a positive value for K, and a positive value for Beta.

2. Initialise a matrix called weights with 1 row and m columns. Each value in this matrix should
be between zero and one, and the sum of all values in weights should be equal to one.

3. Create an empty matrix called centroids.

4. Create a matrix called S with n rows and 1 column, initialise all of its elements to zero.

5. Select K different rows from the data matrix at random.

6. For each of the selected rows
   a. Copy its values to the matrix centroids.
   (at the end of step 6, centroids should have K rows and m columns)

7. For each row i in the data matrix
   a. Calculate the weighted Euclidean distance between data row 𝐷′𝑖 and each row incentroids 
   (use weights and Beta in this calculation, as per equation in the Appendix).

   b. Set 𝑆𝑖 to be equal to the index of the row in centroids that is the nearest to the row
   𝐷′𝑖. For instance, if the nearest row in centroids is row 3, then assign the number 3 to
   row i in S.

8. If the previous step does not change S, stop.

9. For each k = 1, 2, …, K
   a. Update the k row in centroids. Each element j of this row should be equal to the mean
   of the column 𝐷′𝑗 but only taking into consideration those rows whose value in S is
   equal to k (i.e. those who have been assigned to cluster k).

10. For each v = 1, 2, …, m
   a. Update the entry v of the matrix weights (see Appendix).

11. Go to Step 7.

# Weighted Euclidean distance

There are different weighted Euclidean distances, in this assignment you must follow the below. 
The distance between a vector a and a vector b, using the weights in a vector w 
(all three vectors with size m), with a value for Beta

𝑑 = Σ𝑤𝑖 Beta (ai-bj)^2

# Calculating weights

Weights (w in the below) is a vector (a matrix with 1 row and m columns in your implementation). 
To calculate the entry j of this vector (i.e. 𝑤𝑗, that is, row 1 column j of the matrix weights) we first need to
calculate the dispersion of the column j in the data matrix:

Δ𝑗= Σk=1 Σi=1 𝑢𝑖𝑘 (𝐷′𝑖𝑗 − 𝑐𝑘𝑗)^2

where,

n is the number of rows in the data matrix
m is the number of columns in the data matrix (used below)
K is the number of clusters (remember k is not the same thing as K)
c is the matrix centroids
𝑢𝑖𝑘 is equal to one if 𝑆𝑖 = 𝑘, and zero otherwise.


If the value Δ𝑗= 0 then 𝑤𝑗 = 0, otherwise:

𝑤𝑗 = 1 / Σt=1[Δ𝑗/Δ𝑡]^(1/Beta-1)
